      description: |-
        A place where passengers can be picked up or dropped off. This doesn't not necessarilly mean a single stop – instead, a location can be one or many stops and is best thought of as an origin or destination that people might search for when booking a ticket.

        For example, people would generally want book a ticket from anywhere in a bus station, not a particular stance. In addition, your timetable might reference the bus station, rather than the stance number, when it is produced. Only closer to the time will you know the exact stance.

        Another example might be putting a city as a location – e.g. passengers might just want a ticket that goes somewhere in London, rather than being concerned by the exact stop.
